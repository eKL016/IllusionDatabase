Stepping feet? illusion 1 – strong	Cosmos	Motion	Color/High contrast/Brightness	Relation/Similar	Pattern/Stripe	Layers					Motion/Appearing/Shake	Motion/Variation/Synchrony	Motion/Variation/Continuity				“Stepping feet” Motion Illusion.gif		"Observe the movement of blue and yellow “feet”. The feet seem to step alternately, like tiny feet going tip-tap-tip-tap… This is more pronounced if you do not look directly on the feet, but between them. In reality their movement is always simultaneous."	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-feetLin/index.html
Motion Aftereffect – also known as ?waterfall effect?	HsinYu	Pattern/Stripe	Motion/Periodic	Gaze/Focus	Color/High contrast/Brightness	Motion/Linear	Pattern/Radial				Geometry/Variation/Shape	Motion/Appearing/Rotation					Motion Aftereffect.gif		Fixate on the central cross during the motion. Observe the motion aftereffect in the resting figure (the Buddha of Kamakura). The “warping” caused by the motion aftereffect applies to anything you look at.	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-adapt/index.html
Reverse Phi Motion – something for the specialist	Eden	Motion/Others	Motion/Flickering	Color/High contrast/Others	Relation/Identical	Color/Chromatic transition	Filter/Others	Action/Round robin	Motion/Periodic		Motion/Appearing/Others								There is a movie in which something looks like moving but does not in fact.	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-reversePhi/index.html
?Rotating Snakes? Illusion – with a new explanatory twist	Melody	Shape/Circle	Relation/Periphery and center	Color/Others	Pattern/Radial	Pattern/Others					Motion/Appearing/Rotation						Rotating Snake.gif		"The image demonstrates strong rotation of the “wheels”, occurring in relation to eye movements. On steady fixation the effect vanishes."	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakes/index.html
Snake ad lib – optimising this motion illusion	Cosmos	Color/High contrast	Gaze/Peripheral	Shape/Polygon							Geometry/Variation/Size						Snake Illusion “ad lib”.gif		"The pattern at the right is stationary – yet it seems to expand, especially if you don’t look directly at it, for instance when reading this text."	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakeAdLib/index.html
“Rotating Snakes” – with luminance control	HsinYu	Shape/Circle	Relation/Periphery and center	Color/Others	Pattern/Stripe	Pattern/Radial					Motion/Appearing/Rotation						“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control.gif		When looking around the above static image you might see illusory rotation.	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/index.html
Motion Induced Blindness – an illusion of disappearing dots	Eden	Gaze/Focus	Motion/Rotation	Pattern/Stripe	Relation/Periphery and center	Shape/Straight line & Rectangle	Pattern/Dot	Gaze/Peripheral	Pattern/Grid		Geometry/Disappearing/Dot								Stare at the flashing dot in the center and then the yellow spots disappear once in a while.	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-mib/index.html
Stereokinetic Phenomenon – an optical illusion of 3D from motion (aka ?kinetic depth effect?)	Melody	Motion/Periodic	Motion/Rotation	Pattern/Others	Shape/Circle	Color/Others					2D ↔ 3D						Stereokinetic Effect(SKE).gif		Rotation of adequate figures creates a three-dimensional illusion.	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-ske/index.html
Motion silences hue changes – winner of the illusion contest 2011	Cosmos	Gaze/Focus	Motion/Rotation	Color/Chromatic transition	Action/Round robin	Relation/Similar					Hiding						Silencing by Motion.gif		It is hard to perceive the color change during the rotation.	https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-silencing/index.html
